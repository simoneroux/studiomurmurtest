                    <p> <span style="font-family: lato-black;">Studio murmur</span> reflects my desire to work with my clients in their raw form and build something together, like an artist with white walls and wooden shelves who exposes their works and materials in a way that highlights their distinctive and authentic light. <br><br>I always wanted to be an artisan or a builder. Instead, I studied classical history, finance, and heritage preservation. I’ve mastered research and writing, financial psychology and market theories and the processes behind what we choose to leave for future generations. I use what I learned as an entrepreneur and urban pioneer to help my clients achieve sustainable growth that is aligned with their core values.<br><br> My own values, which show up in all levels of my work, are authenticity, collaboration, stewardship, professional ethics, and support for ecological regeneration. <br><br>

                            <br><span style="font-family: lato-black;"> I offer tailored support in :</span> <br><br>
                            Financing and Grant Applications (public and private), even when you don’t know how to communicate your project yet !<br><br>
                            Strategic planning, where marrying the bottom line and social impact are key<br><br>
                            Governance planning, for complex projects big and small in the non-profit sector<br><br>
                            Modernizing and improving your organization's financial and administrative tools - especially if you dislike the mere mention of it.<br><br><br>

                            <span style="font-family: lato-black;">Before founding Studio Murmur</span>, I worked in Montréal’s financial sector as a portfolio advisor. After completing a Master’s in Conservation with a focus on temporary use, I contributed to several pioneering initiatives in urban innovation and heritage. I co-founded the Festival Vivre le Patrimoine (2015–2016), a citizen-led event that showcased Montréal’s heritage through a living and inclusive lens. In 2016, I co-founded Entremise, a social-economy non-profit that brought temporary use into Montréal and Québec public policy <br><br>. As Director General of Entremise, I successfully developed a sustainable hybrid model for growth and co-led the Young Project (2017–2018), the first proof of concept for temporary use in collaboration with the City of Montréal, which enabled more than 35 organizations to occupy a former public warehouse in Griffintown. In 2017, I coordinated the Conseil jeunesse de Montréal’s strategic brief on vacant space and co-organized the Symposium on Temporary Uses, both of which equipped institutional and cultural stakeholders with practical tools. From 2019 to 2021, I also contributed to the creation of Espace Ville Autrement, a flagship site for urban experimentation on the UQAM campus, combining academic research, citizen practices, and the social economy.
